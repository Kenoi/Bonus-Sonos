# Bonus-Sonos
Bonus Sonos is a collection of programs which allow extra features to work on Sonos sound systems. The programs should be loaded and left to run in the background of a computer for these features to work. At the moment all of the programs interactions with the Sonos speakers is done through the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) python module and all currently in development features are being built with SoCo.

I can confirm this works with Sonos One and Sonos Play:1. I have no reason to believe that it will not work with other Sonos speaker. If someone tries this on other speakers please add to the README.
