# Bonus-Sonos
Bonus Sonos is a collection of programs which allow extra features to work on Sonos sound systems. The programs should be loaded and left to run in the background of a computer for these features to work. At the moment all of the programs interactions with the Sonos speakers is done through the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) python module and all currently in development features are being built with SoCo.
<h3>Default To Radio</h3>
The default to radio feature allows a Sonos speaker to revert to a specific radio station or other media after a period of inactivity when the speaker is paused. This removes the hassel of having to use the app to set the sonos to play the radio if someone has paused and left media in the queue.
<h3>Parts Bin</h3>
The parts bin is part of the repository where I will put bits of code which do a very limited task but are a part of larger features or features I am working on at the moment. These could be useful if people want to make their own features for sonos.
<h3>Compatability</h3>
I can confirm this works with Sonos One and Sonos Play:1. I have no reason to believe that it will not work with other Sonos speaker. If someone tries this on other speakers please add to the README.
